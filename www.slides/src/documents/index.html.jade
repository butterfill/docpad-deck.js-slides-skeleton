  What grounds our thinking about shared agency?
  
  Maybe start with collective goals and distinguishing the thing to be explained from the thing
  that explains it.
  
  Then use this to talk about shared agency too.
  
  Examples arenâ€™t enough.
  
  Do we want to start with philosophical/commonsense notions? Do these provide a foundation for a theory?
  
  I. Cooperation
  
  II. Motor Representation
  
    Why think about motor representations?
    Challenges to starting from Intention, Knowledge etc
      - Very small scale cases
      - A model with no clear link to mechanisms (vs a model with at least tentative connections to the brain)
      - Hard to create testable hypotheses with readily testable predictions (and no alternative way to verify theories)
