title: Docpad Deck.js Slides Skeleton
description:
  This is the main project for my `deck.js` slide creator.
  It includes the code for animations.

  The mixins (fragments) are in a subproject.

  The `deck.js` code is now used as `pugdeck` as part of the rmx project.
  (That project does not rely on docpad any more.)

  This code remains the canonical source for my customised version of `deck.js`
  along with the custom deck.js css and the plugins (especially the animation plugin).
