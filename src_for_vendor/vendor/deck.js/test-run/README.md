# Deck.js Test Run Sandbox

This Vite project gives contributors a fast way to preview changes to the customised deck.js build.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Launch the dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Vite will open `http://localhost:5173` with a three-slide demo deck. Edit `index.html` or files under `src/` and watch the deck refresh instantly.

The project imports the unminified sources from `../` so you always exercise the latest local code. Toggle plugins while testing: `m` for the menu, `n` for notes (use `Shift+N` for export view), and arrow keys for navigation.
