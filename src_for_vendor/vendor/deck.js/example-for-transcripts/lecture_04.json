While we'll continue to learn more about those, the part focused solely on understanding them is finished. Today, we start Part II, which examines the consequences of discoveries in moral psychology for understanding political conflict. Over today and the next lecture, we'll focus specifically on political conflict over climate change, as it's the most studied case, though other areas are also relevant."

    "transcript_text": "One major area of political conflict concerns sexual orientation. An interesting trend observed in many places is that people identifying as more socially conservative tend to exhibit stronger homophobia \\citep{barnett:2018_economic}. Why is this? A common thought links it to religion, as conservatives often tend to be more religious, and many major religions include prohibitions against homosexuality. However, this explanation seems less plausible when considering the interpretive flexibility within religions. For example, monotheistic religions have been derived from texts mentioning demigods breeding with humans (see \\citet{hendel:1987_demigods} on Genesis 6:1-4), and stances on issues like usury vary widely. Religious texts contain many claims and prohibitions, but adherence is often selective. Therefore, using religious orientation alone to explain homophobia seems difficult. While religion might sustain such attitudes in a society, it's unlikely to be the root cause. An alternative, interesting possibility is that cultural differences in ethical abilities and attitudes explain varying levels of homophobia between socially conservative and liberal individuals."

    "transcript_text": "This possibility is explored by \\citet{barnett:2018_economic}, who studied the relationship between political orientation, homophobia, and what moral psychologists call 'binding foundations' versus 'individualizing foundations'. Binding foundations relate to group cohesion and include concerns about loyalty, authority, and purity. Individualizing foundations relate to individual needs and include concerns about harm and fairness. Barnett and colleagues found that political ideology's effect on homophobia was mediated primarily through these binding foundations. This suggests that moral psychology, specifically differences in emphasis on these foundational concerns, might explain variations in homophobia across political groups, rather than political orientation itself or religion. This finding aligns with other research suggesting purity concerns, in particular, are strong predictors of attitudes towards homosexuality \\citep{lai:2014_moral, koleva:2012_tracing}. This example illustrates how moral psychology can potentially illuminate political conflict."

As mentioned in the first lecture, there's a notable divide in many countries: people identifying as socially liberal tend to express greater belief in, concern about, and support for action on climate change compared to those identifying as socially conservative \\citep{mccright:2016_political}. This is puzzling because climate change consequences presumably affect everyone regardless of social ideology. It's strange that these groups would differ so markedly. Interestingly, this divide is not universal; it's notably absent in the general publics of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe \\citep[p. 351]{mccright:2016_political}. This variation makes the puzzle even more intriguing: why does this liberal-conservative divide on climate change exist in some places but not others?"

Their answer involves five key steps or considerations: \n1. 'Moral convictions and the emotions they evoke shape political attitudes'. \n2. Descriptive moral pluralism is true; people's moral psychology involves multiple distinct domains like harm and purity, not reducible to one ultimate concern. (We'll delve into the specifics, including Moral Foundations Theory, later).\n3. 'Liberals and conservatives possess different moral profiles'; there's cultural variation in ethical priorities between these groups.\n4. 'Liberals are more likely to view environmental issues in moral terms'. This connects the previous points: if moral attitudes drive behaviour (1), and liberals/conservatives differ morally (3), liberals seeing climate change as moral could explain their greater concern.\n5. 'Exposing conservatives to proenvironmental appeals based on moral concerns that uniquely resonate with them will lead them to view the environment in moral terms and be more supportive of proenvironmental efforts.' This suggests potential interventions based on understanding these different moral profiles.\nThis argument aims to explain the puzzling political divide on climate change and suggests practical ways to bridge it."

The term 'shape' is metaphorical; I interpret it as meaning 'explain'. We're interested not just in attitudes but also behaviours, as attitudes don't always align with actions. Feinberg and Willer use the term 'conviction', which I'll treat as synonymous with 'attitude' for our purposes, as much research focuses on attitudes generally (see glossary entry for \\\"moral-conviction\\\", citing \\citet{skitka:2005_moral}). They provide citations, and as critical readers, we must examine whether this evidence actually supports their claim about *political* attitudes and behaviours."

In contrast, feelings about issues like infanticide, abortion, or gay marriage are often experienced as both strong and moral \\citep[p. 31]{skitka:2008_moral}. When studying attitudes, researchers measure 'strength' using dimensions like extremity (how far from neutral?), importance (how personally significant?), centrality (how linked to self-concept?), and certainty. The goal is often to see if an attitude being *moral* has effects beyond what can be explained by its *strength* alone."

The connection to *political* attitudes seems indirect at best. While one might argue that preferences about social interaction have political implications, the link isn't explicit. If citing this in an essay for the claim about political attitudes, one would need to explain the connection rather than assuming it's direct.

Imagine engineers at Volkswagen considering cheating on emissions tests. They'd want to know: First, how certain can we be that this will lead to premature deaths (statistical significance)? Second, if we do this, how many extra deaths will occur (effect size)? Significance tells us the likelihood that an observed pattern isn't just due to chance. Effect size tells us the magnitude or practical importance of the effect. The VW fraud was estimated to cause around 1200 premature deaths in Europe \\citep{chossiere:2017_public}. We can be highly certain (significant) that a single gunshot kills someone, but the effect size (one death) is small compared to the VW case (many deaths, high effect size). When asking if attitudes explain behaviour, we're primarily interested in the effect size: how much of the variation in behaviour can be attributed to variation in attitudes?"

Similarly, believers report stronger intentions to act environmentally (medium effect size, r = .32), but the correlation with actual reported behaviours is modest (small effect size, r = .17).

He noted that 'Only rarely can as much as 10% of the variance in overt behavioral measures be accounted for by attitudinal data.' Furthermore, 'substantial proportions of subjects show attitude-behavior discrepancies.

The researchers wanted to see if prejudiced attitudes predicted discriminatory aggression. The results were interesting: high-prejudice subjects were more aggressive overall (delivered more shocks) than low-prejudice subjects. However, crucially, the high-prejudice subjects 'aggressed equally against' both Black and White opponents \\citep[p. 209]{genthner:1973_physical}.

They found an asymmetry: people expect someone who commits an impure act to be more likely to commit *both* further impure acts *and* harmful acts in the future. However, they expect someone who commits a harmful act to be more likely to commit further harmful acts, but *not* necessarily more likely to commit impure acts. If all moral judgments boiled down to harm, we wouldn't expect this asymmetry. The fact that purity violations lead to different inferences about future behaviour than harm violations suggests that people treat these as distinct moral domains.

This shows genetic evolution responding to dietary pressures."

Given the relatively short time frame for our global expansion compared to the time other hominins had to adapt regionally, and the relative genetic homogeneity of H. sapiens, cultural adaptations, including moral norms, likely played a much larger role. Just as saliva composition varies with diet, ethical concerns might also vary in ways that help populations adapt to local challenges."

This relationship held even when controlling for individual factors like political orientation, gender, education, and age. However, historical pathogen prevalence did *not* predict endorsement of the 'individualizing foundations' (Harm/care and Fairness/reciprocity). This suggests that concerns like purity may have been culturally amplified in regions where avoiding pathogens was a critical historical challenge, perhaps related to food preparation and hygiene practices \\citep[see also][]{atari:2022_pathogens}. As \\citet[p. 93]{graham:2013_chapter} note, citing others, groups develop unique practices to reduce pathogen exposure, and foreign practices might be perceived as contamination risks.

Other research links purity to views on stem cell research, environmental attitudes \\citep{rottman:2015_hinderinga}, and even social distancing. This predictive power suggests purity operates as a distinct psychological construct, not simply reducible to harm.

While reasoning might sometimes influence one's own judgment (the dotted 'private reflection' link, considered rare outside philosophy), its main causal role is social: one person's reasoning influences *another* person's intuitions (the 'reasoned persuasion' link).
