One thing I want to do in this lecture is to continue exploring whether the presupposition of this puzzle is true. That's important because it's difficult to answer that question.\n\nSecond puzzle: In the last part of the lecture, I will show you some evidence that patterns in moral intuitions reflect legal principles that humans are typically unaware of, and that will create a second puzzle for us.\n\nI like this pair of puzzles because the theories we will consider are attempts to address one or the other. However, I think the challenge for you and for me is to address both puzzles simultaneously. An adequate theory has to solve both puzzles, not just one. That's a good challenge, suggesting we may need a deeper understanding than the theories considered today will offer."

    "transcript_text": "Moral psychology can distinguish actual motivation from avowed motivation. For example, I mentioned in the first lecture the scenario where somebody uses the carcass of a chicken for sexual pleasure and then serves it for dinner. Most people say that's wrong. If I ask you why, some of us, including me, might first try to talk about potential harms: it's disrespectful to the animal, maybe there's a risk of poisoning, etc. We look for harms. But it may be that what's really driving the response there is not concern about harm at all (the chicken's dead), but rather disgust.\n\nNow, that, of course, is speculation. One thing about moral psychology is that researchers have provided methods to successfully dissociate the reasons you *avow* for making a judgement from the factors which *actually explain* why you make that judgement. By distinguishing those, we can gain useful clues about how to make changes in our societies.\n\nLet me start by noting that there are at least three kinds of disgust which have been important for humans for a long time. \\citet{tybur:2009_microbes} distinguish pathogen disgust (germs, loosely speaking), sexual disgust, and injury disgust. They argue it's possible, using statistical methods, to show these are three separate factors explaining disgust responses. As you might imagine, back in the day, these forms of disgust were important for humans.\n\nToday we'll focus on pathogen disgust. You can see why that was important if you reflect on our history. A couple of million years ago, hominins were scavengers. Lions would kill an animal, have a go at it, then hyenas would come along. Humans are super well-adapted, compared to other mammals, to be out in the hottest part of the day. We're extremely good at dumping heat. This means we could get out there when other mammals were sleeping and have our fill on that carcass. The problem is, the carcass has been slobbered over by lions and hyenas. We had to approach it carefully. We tried to get there before the vultures. Vultures are efficient; they'll stick their head through the anus to feast on internal organs. As a human, you must not do that because you don't have the vulture's immune system. You're good at not getting too hot, but you lack the vulture's immunity (nor can you fly). Pathogen disgust is crucial; it's the adaptation that keeps you safe, keeping you away from disgusting things because they are generally dangerous.\n\nOf course, a lot has changed since then. Once fire came along, we could obtain food more effectively. Herman Pontzer, in his book \\citep{pontzer:2021_burn}, recalls visiting the Hadza, hunter-gatherers in Tanzania. He was terrified in his tent by lion sounds. At dawn, some Hadza men showed him an antelope they'd acquired. He asked how they got it so early. They replied, 'We took it from the lions.' Even today, human food practices involve scavenging and not always the cleanest food. Pathogen disgust remains useful. However, as we'll see, you can experience pathogen disgust in ways completely irrelevant to its historical benefits, potentially leading to maladaptive responses in modern contexts."

    "transcript_text": "One interesting, very recent innovation is the bathroom. In the United States, there's a culture war over bathroom policies. Some people, and I believe it's law in some places, think you need a birth certificate stating 'woman' or 'man' to use certain bathrooms. There are supporters and opponents of these laws, and I understand some UK politicians want a similar system here. So, it's a relevant issue.\n\nWe want to ask: which factors influence attitudes towards these policies? Why do some support restrictions, while others advocate for choosing the toilet one feels most comfortable with?\n\nTwo bits of background: First, if you survey the arguments from both sides, they often revolve around concerns about harm. The avowed motivation is harm reduction – claiming their preferred policy reduces harm. Second, in the US (we only have US samples), a large proportion, perhaps half, feel *pathogen disgust* when encountering a visibly trans person. This is widespread; you might have heard someone say, 'At some level, I feel disgust.'\n\nSo, \\citet{vanaman:2020_disgust} (Hannah Chapman is a brilliant researcher you'll encounter often) did something simple. They measured people's general views about harm, their sensitivity to pathogen disgust (people vary greatly), and then statistically determined to what extent harm concerns versus pathogen disgust sensitivity contribute to views on toilet access. This is brilliant because it questions whether people's avowed motivation (harm) is the actual driver."

For pathogen disgust, they might ask: How disgusting is stepping in dog poo? Does it wreck your day, or do you just wipe it off? How disgusting is seeing mould on leftovers? Are you fascinated or repulsed? Finding a hair in your food at a hotel – do you pick it out or is breakfast ruined? People rate these on a scale from 'not at all disgusting' to 'extremely disgusting'. Personally, I was surprised these are disgusting to some, but people vary."

    "transcript_text": "Vanaman and Chapman considered various models linked to specific hypotheses. This particular model explores the effect of concerns about harm. The hypothesis is that pathogen disgust might make you more aware of harm issues, which then explains support for bathroom restrictions. The model tests the strength of different pathways: pathogen disgust directly influencing support, or indirectly via general purity concerns, or indirectly via general harm concerns.\n\nWhat they found using this model is interesting. There *is* an effect of harm sensitivity on support for restrictions, but it's only about one-third the strength of the effect mediated by purity concerns. When pathogen disgust is mediated by purity, it has a very large effect on willingness to impose restrictions, much larger than the indirect effect via harm concerns. (The handout notes this aligns with Moral Foundations Theory, where disgust sensitivity is primarily linked to purity-based moral judgments, see \\citet{wagemans:2018_disgust})."

    "transcript_text": "Overall, across various models, \\citet{vanaman:2020_disgust} found that attitudes towards policies limiting toilet choice are mainly a consequence of disgust (specifically pathogen disgust, often mediated by purity concerns), not primarily concern about harm. This finding has practical implications. If this debate comes to the UK and you want to make a difference, arguing about harms is unlikely to be effective because harm concerns aren't the main driver. The effective way, according to these findings, is to change how people *feel*. One way is by increasing familiarity with transgender people. As \\citet{vanaman:2020_disgust} suggest (p. 211), interventions targeting disgust and disgust-driven moral concerns are likely to have a larger impact than arguments about harm.\n\nThey draw a comparison to sushi, initially regarded as disgusting in some cultures due to unfamiliarity, but becoming delicious as it became familiar. Change happens not just by arguing, but by making the unfamiliar familiar. Then we can appreciate the benefits, like evolving ideas about gender.\n\nThis study has theoretical importance for us: it shows moral psychology methods can distinguish actual motivation from avowed motivation, and these can differ dramatically. It's evidence that disgust influences moral attitudes. And it illustrates the 'gap' I mentioned."

    "transcript_text": "This illustrates the gap between actual and avowed motivation. It also highlights the gap between our ancient ethical responses and modern challenges. Pathogen disgust is an old ethical driver, evolved over hundreds of thousands, probably millions of years of scavenging. But the challenges we face involve recent technology and social changes. Bathrooms are maybe 200-300 years old, and still not universal. Contemporary ideas about gender are also relatively recent, especially considering large-scale farming and pastoralism (allowing novel patriarchal structures) are only about 10,000 years old. We have rapidly advancing technologies and social structures, but much of our ethics seems driven by older, slower-changing systems like pathogen disgust. This is the gap. Recognizing it is the first step. Many doing applied ethics might not consider the moral psychology of emotions, thus being blind to this gap and how it works. Understanding these drivers is crucial for addressing cultural disagreements and making progress."

    "transcript_text": "Jonathan Haidt, a psychologist we'll see more of later, claims 'the central phenomena [in morality] are moral emotions and intuitions' (\\citet{haidt:2008_moralitya}, p. 65). I think Haidt means these are foundational: moral emotions and intuitions can exist independently, but other moral abilities couldn't exist without them, practically speaking for humans.\n\nWe asked two key questions:\nQ1: How, if at all, do emotions influence moral intuitions?\nQ2: What do humans compute that enables them to track moral attributes?\n\nHaidt offers an answer to both. He thinks tracking moral attributes is mainly about responding to emotions (like pathogen disgust). Thus, emotions directly affect moral intuitions because intuitions *are*, in effect, emotional responses.\n\nThis idea is captured by Hypothesis 1, the 'Affect Heuristic', as described by \\citet{sinnott:2010_moral}: 'if thinking about an act [...] makes you feel bad [...], then judge that it is morally wrong'. (This is one hypothesis; we'll consider an incompatible one later).\n\nThe Affect Heuristic applies specifically to *moral intuitions*, which, following my definition (see glossary), are claims accepted independently of inferential justification. It's not about all moral judgements, which can involve reflection and principles. I want to spend a bit more time explaining what a heuristic is."

    "transcript_text": "In this context, 'heuristic' has a special technical sense. A heuristic links an *inaccessible* attribute to an *accessible* attribute such that, within a limited but useful range of situations, someone could track the inaccessible attribute by computing the accessible attribute.\n\nWhat's an attribute? A feature of something. Being 178cm tall is an attribute of me. Being switched on is an attribute of your laptop. Kicking a baby seal is a bad action; badness is an attribute of the action.\n\nWhat about accessible/inaccessible? We follow \\citet{kahneman:2005_model} (p. 271): 'accessibility refers to the ease (or effort) with which particular mental contents come to mind.' If I ask the population of Sweden, that's inaccessible for most – hard to bring to mind without looking it up. If I ask how many people you know from Switzerland, that's relatively accessible – easier to bring to mind. Accessibility is a matter of degree; things are more or less accessible. We treat it as binary for simplicity in the definition, but it's a continuum. Recognizing this avoids uncharitable objections based on a strict binary view.\n\nHeuristics are important because, like all animals, we face trade-offs, often needing speed over accuracy. Computing inaccessible attributes is slow. Heuristics let us substitute an accessible attribute for an inaccessible one, trading accuracy for speed. This is also important because brain power is energetically expensive (about 20% of resting energy use, see \\citet{raichle:2002_appraising}). Using heuristics saves cognitive effort.\n\nExample: The poison detector. Deciding not to eat smelly leftovers uses a heuristic: the accessible attribute (how it smells/tastes/makes you feel) tracks the inaccessible attribute (toxicity, which requires lab tests). The Affect Heuristic hypothesis suggests we do something similar for morality: using accessible feelings (like disgust) to track inaccessible moral attributes (like rightness/wrongness)."

(Think of Obama's line: risk of dying from slipping in the bath vs. terrorism; the latter causes more dread).\n*Prediction*: Risk judgements will correlate with participants' own feelings of dread about that cause of death.\n\nThe results broadly confirmed these predictions. \\citet{pachur:2012_how} found that 'availability-by-recall offered a substantially better descriptive account than the affect heuristic when people judged deindividualized, statistical mortality rates. Affect, however, was at least on par with availability when people [...] were asked to indicate the perceived risk of dying' (p. 324). They also found dread could be gauged simply by asking how much dread a risk evokes.\n\nThis study provides a model: to show a heuristic is used, demonstrate that judgements are determined by an accessible attribute (like cases in social network, or feelings of dread/disgust)."

    "transcript_text": "A heuristic links an inaccessible attribute to an accessible one, allowing tracking via computation of the accessible attribute. The cost is reduced accuracy and potential bias. For example, participants in the \\citet{pachur:2012_how} study wrongly thought dying from syphilis was about four times more likely than dying from a tornado in Switzerland, when the reverse is true (though both are very rare). This bias likely arises because syphilis evokes more dread than tornadoes for most people. Despite such biases, overall, people's rankings were relatively accurate given their limited information. The benefit is speed and reduced effort. This speed-accuracy trade-off is why heuristics are a key feature of cognition. Philosophers often focus on slow, deliberate thinking, but much of life requires fast responses, which heuristics enable."

    "transcript_text": "So, we understand heuristics and their significance (speed-accuracy trade-offs). But the Affect Heuristic in morality is claimed to be significant in further ways.\n\n*Implication 1: No Direct Insight.* \\citet{sinnott:2010_moral} argue, 'if moral intuitions result from heuristics, [... philosophers] must stop claiming direct insight into moral properties' (p. 268). They seem to target views like epistemological intuitionism, described by \\citet{stratton-lake:2002_ethical} as the view that some moral propositions are self-evident, known directly by intuition upon adequate understanding (p. 2). The challenge is: what feels like direct insight might just be the operation of an unconscious heuristic substituting feeling for moral truth. If this argument holds, it counters claims of self-evidence. However, we should examine if the consequence truly follows or if one could accept both the heuristic and intuitionism.\n\n*Implication 2: Don't Trust Intuitions (especially in novel situations).* 'Just as non-moral heuristics lack reliability in unusual situations, so do moral intuitions' (\\citet{sinnott:2010_moral}, p. 268). Heuristics are adapted to familiar environments (evolutionary, cultural, personal). In *unfamiliar problems* (situations 'with which we have inadequate evolutionary, cultural, or personal experience', \\citet{greene:2014_pointandshoot}, p. 714), their reliability is questionable. We shouldn't trust the availability heuristic about Swiss tornadoes; why trust the affect heuristic about novel ethical dilemmas?\n\n*Relevance to Consequentialism:* This implication helps defend consequentialism against objections based on counter-intuitive judgements. Example: 'Critics often argue that consequentialism can’t be accurate, because it implies moral judgments that are counter-intuitive, such as that we are morally permitted to punish an innocent person [Noah!] in the well-known example where this is necessary to stop riots and prevent deaths. With the heuristic model in hand, consequentialists can respond that the target attribute is having the best consequences, and any intuitions to the contrary result from substituting a heuristic attribute' (\\citet{sinnott:2010_moral}, p. 269). The intuition against punishing Noah might arise from a heuristic ill-suited to this complex, modern scenario involving large groups, communication, prisons – all recent developments. Thus, the intuition isn't a reliable guide and doesn't refute consequentialism.\n\n*Wilson's Stronger Claim:* E. O. Wilson suggested 'ethical philosophers intuit the deontological canons of morality by consulting the emotive centers of their own hypothalamic-limbic system... Only by interpreting the activity of the emotive centers as a biological adaptation can the meaning of the canons be deciphered' (\\citet{wilson:1975_sociobiology}, p. 563, quoted in \\citet{haidt:2008_moralitya}, p. 68). This implies understanding ethics requires knowing about emotions as biological adaptations."

A small effect seems inconsistent with emotion being the primary driver of intuitions as the Affect Heuristic implies.\n\nArguments against rejecting (No):\n*   Small effect size doesn't mean zero effect. The influence might still exist.\n*   Crucially, there's a mismatch: The Affect Heuristic hypothesis is about *intuitions* (claims accepted without inference), but the evidence largely comes from studies measuring *judgements* made after reading vignettes (like the 'Resume' example from \\citet{schnall:2008_disgust}). Participants have time to reflect, apply principles, draw on experience. It's not clear these tasks directly tap intuitions in my defined sense. The link is indirect.\n*   The apparent small effect size might be due to insensitive measures in some studies. More sensitive measures could reveal a larger effect (or confirm it's small, or non-existent).\n*   Newer research, like \\citet{tracy:2019_physiological} (which we'll discuss in seminars), might provide stronger support for a link between disgust and moral judgement.\n\nSo, the situation is complex."

Philosophers like Foot and Thomson saw this pattern as posing a puzzle: why the different responses? Mikhail's answer \\citep{mikhail:2007_universal, mikhail:2014_any} is that the difference lies in a legal distinction involving *purposive battery*. Transplant involves intending harm to the one as a means to save the five (purposive battery), while Trolley involves harm to the one merely as a foreseen side effect of diverting the threat from the five. This distinction, he argues, explains the pattern of judgements, even though people aren't consciously aware of applying this principle."
