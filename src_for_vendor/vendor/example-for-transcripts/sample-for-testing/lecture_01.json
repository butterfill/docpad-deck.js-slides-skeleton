Moral psychology is the study of psychological aspects of ethical abilities \\citep{doris:2017_morala}. We need to be careful here because there is an older tradition in philosophy of using the term 'moral psychology' for a kind of philosophy of action, a narrowly philosophical pursuit. But moral psychology in the modern sense, and for this course, is not that. It really is about psychological aspects of your ethical abilities—philosophy meets psychology meets ethics.\n\nWhat we're looking at is comparable to what we might do in the linguistic domain. You might think it's amazing how humans use language. How is that possible? What are the psychological aspects of humans' linguistic abilities? That would be psycholinguistics. What we're doing in the case of ethics is similar. We could also think about mathematical or aesthetic abilities. In each case, we can ask: what kind of psychological states and processes underpin these abilities? We're doing the same thing for your ethical abilities. You have ethical abilities—to act, judge, feel, give moral suasion, respond to moral suasion, etc.—and we want to know the psychological processes that make that possible. This is moral psychology.\n\nThe course is divided into three parts, each with a question. Part 1 asks: What ethical abilities do humans have? What states and processes underpin them? Part 2 asks: What, if anything, do discoveries about ethical abilities imply for political conflict? Part 3 asks: What do discoveries about ethical abilities imply about ethics? Can we derive challenges to ethical theories, methods, or conclusions from moral psychology?"

    "transcript_text": "Humans have recently begun to live in societies as complex as those of social insects, but without the same reproductive strategies leading to high genetic relatedness. So, why do humans cooperate with non-kin, often complete strangers? Attempts to explain this solely through reciprocity and reputation seem insufficient. \\citet{richerson:1999_complex} suggest that humans are adapted to live in morally structured communities, thanks partly to the capacity for moralistic punishment and susceptibility to moral suasion. Loosely, they suggest complex societies are possible because we have ethical abilities. While they emphasize punishment and suasion, perhaps other factors like concern for harm are also crucial. It's also worth noting that since \\citet{richerson:1999_complex} wrote, evidence suggests humans may have been cooperating with non-kin for much longer than 10,000 years, possibly 50,000 years or more, as seen in studies of hunter-gatherer societies where non-kin are common \\citep{apicella:2012_social, hill:2014_huntergatherer}. This idea isn't limited to evolutionary anthropology. Developmental scientist \\citet{hamlin:2015_infantile} also states that humans develop morality because it's required for cooperative systems to flourish."

Cooperation with non-kin and ethical abilities don't imply humans are inherently 'nice'. 300,000 years ago, Homo sapiens co-existed with other human species. Unlike other primates, Homo sapiens are now evolutionarily isolated. Around 50,000 years ago, Neanderthals and Denisovans disappeared, likely influenced by Homo sapiens. So, there's probably a darker side to human ethical abilities alongside the cooperative aspect."

We'll touch on conflicts over sexual orientation and gender identity later, but the most researched case is political conflict over climate change. This will be our case study. A striking aspect of climate change is the left-right divide: socially liberal individuals tend to see it as important and favour mitigation measures, while socially conservative individuals are often more sceptical. Why is this? It's not simply that conservatives are 'nasty'; many are reasonable people. The association seems somewhat arbitrary. Why might this be the case? Let's speculate: why are socially liberal people generally more concerned and willing to act on climate change than socially conservative people?"

They gave participants one of three vignettes about someone's lunch: a control story, a story where the person recycled packaging, and one where they threw it in the bin. Socially liberal participants rated the non-recycling individual as less moral compared to the other conditions. For socially conservative participants, there was no significant difference. This suggests liberals tend to view climate-related actions like recycling as a moral issue, while conservatives may not. This difference could be significant. Normative attitudes ('I should eat less chocolate') often have little influence on behaviour compared to ethical attitudes. If something is framed as an ethical matter, it's more likely to drive action. So, perhaps liberals are more concerned about climate change because they perceive it as an ethical issue, driving their attitudes and willingness to bear costs. This raises a further question: why would liberals, specifically, see environmental issues in ethical terms?"

We'll examine this theory critically later, but for now, let's consider its claims. One claim is that human ethics starts with several 'foundations' or areas of concern, such as harm/care, equality, proportionality, in-group loyalty, respect for authority, and purity/sanctity. Biologically, we might have capacities related to all these. However, through cultural evolution, different societies emphasize different foundations. Evidence suggests socially liberal individuals emphasize harm/care and equality/fairness much more than the others, sometimes struggling to see issues like purity as moral matters at all. Conversely, for socially conservative individuals, purity, loyalty, and authority are often clear ethical concerns. Assuming this cultural difference exists, and liberals focus more on harm and care..."

    "transcript_text": "...and considering that, as \\citet{markowitz:2012_climate} found, climate change issues are typically framed in terms of harm to present/future generations and unfair distributions, we can see a potential explanation. You have two cultural groups with different moral psychologies. One emphasizes harm and fairness; the other values these less relative to purity or authority. Issues framed in terms of harm and fairness will naturally resonate more with the first group (liberals), leading them to prioritize climate change more. This conjecture can be tested. For example, framing recycling appeals using 'conservative' foundations (purity, authority) increases recycling among conservatives, while framing them using 'liberal' foundations (harm, fairness) works better for liberals. This suggests moral psychology might explain the political conflict over climate change and potentially offer ways to bridge the divide, although we'll see later that the theory faces challenges."

He warns strongly against seeking ethical principles in empirical motives and laws (loose translation adapted from \\citet[pp. 43--4]{kant:2002_groundwork}).

The same authors argue we cannot use intuitions to counterexample theories \\citep{sinnott:2010_moral}. This is significant, as relying on intuitions (e.g., rejecting a theory because it yields a counterintuitive result) is common in ethics. If intuitions are psychologically unreliable, this method is undermined. \\citet{greene:2014_pointandshoot} offers a more nuanced claim: intuitions are unreliable in *unfamiliar* situations, defined as those 'with which we have inadequate evolutionary, cultural, or personal experience' \\citep[p. 714]{greene:2014_pointandshoot}. This would challenge relying on intuitions about novel problems, like those involving new technologies. Greene also argues that understanding moral psychology reveals that philosophers, including Kant, don't use reason to discover right and wrong, but 'primarily to justify and organize their preexising intuitive conclusions' \\citep[p. 718]{greene:2014_pointandshoot}. These are bold claims with potentially dramatic consequences for ethics, making them worth investigating."

A major challenge is our enormous technological progress alongside approximately zero progress in ethics. People worry about the ethics of AI or social media, but the problem is deeper. Even ancient technologies like agriculture or animal domestication created ethical challenges (like wealth inequality) that humans seem poorly equipped to solve. 700 million people live in extreme poverty today—a relatively simple problem to solve financially, yet we haven't. This happens when technology outpaces ethics. I'm interested in moral psychology because the traditional ways of doing ethics over thousands of years haven't closed this gap."

This is the hypothesis from \\citet{sinnott:2010_moral}: moral intuitions result from an affect heuristic. Two caveats: First, they aren't claiming *every* moral judgment works this way, only moral *intuitions*. Second, they aren't claiming you're necessarily aware of feeling bad or consciously substituting the question 'Is this wrong?' with 'Does it make me feel bad?'. The process involves substitution, but it might be unconscious. They aren't making a claim about the phenomenology of intuition.

For a process to *track* an attribute means its unfolding depends (non-accidentally) on whether the attribute is present or absent. *Computing*, by contrast, involves representing attributes in a computational process. Consider a motion detector: it *tracks* human movement but *computes* patterns of infrared energy. It can be fooled (e.g., by large warm animals), but it works within a useful range. The key point: what a system tracks can be very different from what it computes. This allows complex problems to be addressed with simpler mechanisms. When we observe that humans track moral attributes (like wrongness) with their intuitions, we must ask: What do they *compute* to enable this tracking? Philosophers often assume if you have an intuition about wrongness, you must be computing wrongness.

This, in turn, answers Q1: Yes, emotions influence moral intuitions in the most direct way possible—intuitions arise from emotions. But we don't want to stop at 'here's a way things could be'. We want to know if the hypothesis is actually true. To determine that, we need evidence."

A prediction from the Affect Heuristic hypothesis is: if you make people feel bad (e.g., disgusted) without them necessarily realising the source of the feeling, they will be more inclined to judge actions as morally wrong."

They measured participants' Private Body Consciousness (PBC) – how aware people are of internal bodily states \\citep{miller:1981_consciousness} – dividing them into high-PBC and low-PBC groups. Participants watched a disgust-inducing video (from Trainspotting), a sadness-inducing video (from The Champ), or a neutral video (nature documentary) \\citep{lerner:2004_heart}. Then, they judged the wrongness of actions in six moral vignettes. Three vignettes involved disgusting actions (eating a dead dog, cannibalism, sexual contact with a kitten), and three involved non-disgusting moral violations (keeping found money, faking a resume, trolley problem). Their prediction: Induced disgust (but not sadness) would increase the severity of moral judgments, regardless of whether the judged actions were themselves disgusting."

This seems to confirm their hypothesis for this group. However, there was no statistically significant difference for the low-PBC group."

We cannot conclude the hypothesis is false for low-PBC people based on a null result (absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence). Also, be wary of the difference between predicting findings in advance versus retrospectively finding studies that fit a hypothesis. \\citet{sinnott:2010_moral} are, in 2010, offering a hypothesis that explains earlier findings like \\citet{schnall:2008_disgust} (from 2008). This 'retrodiction' carries less argumentative weight than successfully testing a novel prediction."
