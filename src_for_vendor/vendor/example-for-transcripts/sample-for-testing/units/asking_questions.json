    "transcript_text": "Second, attending lectures is crucial. Previously, I viewed lectures as optional, and student performance was high. Last year, with a 9am slot, average marks dropped significantly. The only change seemed to be lecture attendance. This course has no direct equivalent or textbook; the material is unique. If you don't attend lectures, doing well is unlikely. Know yourself: are you going to be here at 9am consistently? If not, my strong advice, despite wanting you here, is to switch modules while you still can. It's better than struggling later."

    "transcript_text": "Third, I won't routinely use lecture capture. I find the recordings unhelpful and often unused. However, there's an exception: if you email me for any reason (missed lecture, disability, etc.), I will send you a link to the recording if one was successfully made."

I expect material covered in lectures to be common ground, so use the search to ensure you've considered relevant lecture content. I have left older recordings online, but please don't rely on them; the lectures change each year with new research and corrections."

    "transcript_text": "This module has weekly seminars starting next week. For each seminar, the online handout provides a task and associated reading. The expectation is that you attend the lecture, do the reading (typically a 20-page article), make notes on the seminar question, and bring those notes for discussion."

    "transcript_text": "The reading list is structured differently than usual. There isn't a single main list. Instead, readings are assigned via seminar tasks, associated with essay questions, and linked from the lecture handout for topics discussed in lectures. I encourage you to follow your interests â€“ some might focus on philosophical sources, others on cognitive science or neuroscience aspects. If you read about ten relevant items over the term (from seminars, essay prep, lecture follow-up), you'll be well-prepared. The reading is distributed this way to allow flexibility."
