Part I and Part III are connected; we're going to learn things in Part III that belong in Part I anyway. In particular, not in this lecture but in a later one, we're going to attempt to resolve some of the puzzles encountered in the first lecture. I think those puzzles are solvable, and we know roughly what the solution is, though some people here might disagree with my attempts."

    "transcript_text": "The question for this whole part of the course, and one of the long essay questions, is: Could discoveries in moral psychology undermine or support ethical principles or theories? Over the next three lectures, you'll see many different ways to answer this question. If I could pick just one long essay question for everyone, it would be this one, because there are so many ways to approach it.\n\nThere's another way to formulate this question that points towards a particular approach I like, although it's complicated. I've included it here: Is there any route to knowledge of an ethical principle’s truth or falsity which nontrivially depends on premises known through scientific discovery? This assumes we *can* have moral knowledge and asks if science can contribute. This is the version we'll focus on today, but it's not the only way.\n\nAs mentioned at the start of the course, some philosophers, like Kant, think the answer is clearly no. In a rather strong passage \\citep[p. AK 4:425--6]{kant:1870_grundlegung}, he writes that everything empirical is not only unfit as a contribution to the principle of morality but is even highly detrimental to the integrity of morals. Is that true? That's a good question. If we can find any positive answer to our main question, we'll have taken a position showing Kant was wrong."

This often involves anti-intuition arguments.\n\nHowever, today (Phase 1), I want to take a different approach, one you won't find much in the literature but which I think is worthwhile for two reasons. First, it gives insight into how ethics actually works by looking at particular ethical arguments, which is more specific and perhaps more engaging than the general approach. Second, it provides a template for a potential essay: find places where a specific philosopher's ethical argument relies on an empirical claim, and explore how scientific discoveries about that claim affect our assessment of the argument. We're looking for arguments presented as ethics that rely on premises where scientific findings can enhance our understanding."

May we manufacture the gas? According to the doctrine of double effect, the death of the single patient is a foreseen side effect (oblique intention), not the direct intention, similar to the drug case. Therefore, if the doctrine explained our judgements, we should say manufacturing the gas is permissible. However, Foot claims most people judge it impermissible, unlike diverting the drug.

Moral psychologists, using systematic observation, have advanced our understanding of this empirical issue.

Either moral psychology shows that Foot's method cannot work because judgements are influenced by too many irrelevant factors (which implies moral psychology *is* relevant to ethics), or Foot's method *can* work, but requires empirical input from moral psychology to identify the *actual* determinants of judgement (which also implies moral psychology is relevant)."

When effort was removed ('Not-Necessary' condition), distance had no significant effect on obligation ratings. \nNagel and Waldmann concluded across several experiments: 'Apparent distance effects... turned out to be explainable in terms of confounded factors such as informational directness..., group membership..., or relative efficaciousness...

Similarly, financial experts rely on intuitions despite known biases. If we don't dismiss judgements wholesale in those domains due to framing effects, why should we do so for ethics? To make the argument work specifically against moral intuitions, one needs to show why framing effects are more damaging in the moral domain than elsewhere.

Our preferences are about framed problems, and our moral intuitions are about descriptions, not about substance'. If this were true specifically for moral intuitions, it would mean they aren't tracking any underlying moral reality (substance) at all, only superficial features of the description (frame). In contrast, spatial judgements, despite framing effects, arguably *are* about an underlying substance (physical distance).\n\n[Student Question: What's the difference between substance and description?] \nIn the spatial case, the 'substance' is the actual distance. The 'description' or 'frame' includes irrelevant elements like the nearby person. Kahneman's suggestion for morality is that there might *be* no underlying 'substance' (stable moral facts or principles) that our intuitions are tracking, however imperfectly. Instead, maybe the intuitions are *only* responses to the way the problem is described, including irrelevant framing elements. If true, this would support Sinnott-Armstrong. However, establishing this claim requires a strong argument, which Kahneman doesn't fully provide in this context. We might look for supporting evidence, perhaps in the sheer variety of factors found to influence moral judgements \\citep{waldmann:2012_moral}, suggesting they aren't tracking a single coherent 'substance'."
