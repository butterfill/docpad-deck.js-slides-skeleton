    "transcript_text": "Welcome back to moral psychology. You know that in this second part of the course, we are focused on the question: Do cultural differences in moral psychology explain political conflict on climate change? Our plan is to work through a single short journal article, \\citet{feinberg:2013_moral}'s 'The Moral Roots of Environmental Attitudes', and see what we can make of the argument in that article. Have I got a good reconstruction of the argument? Is the evidence for each of the premises strong? And if the premises are true, do they explain what we observe: political conflict over climate change? We started last week, and we're going to finish that today. This part two of the course is just this week and next week. Then we've got reading week, and when you come back, we've got four weeks on part three. So this is the end of the little bit on cultural variation in moral psychology."

    "transcript_text": "Now it's early, and I know that there might be some people coming in late, so I like to start with a little bit of optional background. This is a time where you can feel free to relax and ignore me; I'm not offering something that I think will be helpful particularly for your essay, just a bit of background.\n\nWhat I'm really interested in is cultural variation in people's ethical attitudes. I think this is fascinating, but it's also something we need to put into context. Why are humans just so terrible at dealing with cultural variation in ethical foundations? \n\n[Combined with later section on Feinberg & Willer, 2015 study:] In fact, I'll show you a bit later a study where people are asked to present an argument for people with different moral views \\citep{feinberg:2015_gulfa}. If you tend to think in terms of harm and fairness, you're asked to present a view using considerations like respect for authority and purity. Conversely, if you put emphasis on purity and respect for authority, you're asked to present arguments appealing to someone with a different moral outlook. What's striking is that very few people succeeded, even with a substantial monetary reward ($50). People generally framed arguments using their own ethical attitudes, not those of their target audience. Moreover, a significant proportion—about a third—actually wrote pieces attacking the other side's ethical attitudes instead of attempting persuasion. Humans are just really bad at dealing with cultural variation in ethical attitudes.\n\nThis has tragic consequences, especially regarding climate change, which is now relatively simple and inexpensive to mitigate, yet we're failing. Why are we so bad at this?\n\nWell, Homo sapiens, our species, is relatively young—around 300,000 years old, perhaps 12,000-15,000 generations. Compare that to Neanderthals (around 500,000 years) or Homo erectus (nearly 2 million years). We're the last human species standing, originating from a planet with many human species. For much of our history, we were marginal, with a small population in Africa (around 20,000-30,000 individuals). Early migrations out of Africa around 100,000 years ago didn't last long. Around 70,000-80,000 years ago, a disaster, likely climate-related, reduced our population to just a few thousand, maybe only a thousand breeders. We almost went extinct.\n\nBut then, around 50,000 years ago, an amazing cultural revolution occurred. We saw explosions in uniquely Homo sapiens activities: ritual, art, trade, and toolmaking. This coincided with our spread across the globe and the disappearance of other human species. Our unusual ethical abilities likely emerged and played a crucial role during this time. Abilities like respect for authority (and its counterpart, reverse hierarchical dominance to control overbearing leaders), concerns with purity (acting as a behavioural immune system), and cooperation (enabling food sharing, reducing starvation risk, facilitating cooperative breeding) gave us advantages.\n\nFor most of the last 50,000 years (around 2,000 generations), we were roughly 100,000 hunter-gatherers living in small, dispersed bands of about 30. Farming became widespread only in the last 5,000 years (around 200 generations). Cities are even more recent, existing for perhaps 240 generations, but city living is a very recent phenomenon for most people. For most of the last 5,000 years, less than 2% of the global population lived in cities, which were often pathogen magnets. It wasn't until 2007 that over half of humans became city dwellers. Most of us likely have only about eight generations of city-dwelling ancestry.\n\nWhy stress this? Our ethical abilities are products of biological and cultural evolution over perhaps 50,000 years. The *problem* of cultural variation in ethical attitudes is very recent. In small communities or even larger ones where most people lacked wealth or political power, these differences didn't matter much. For nearly all of human history, cultural variation in ethical attitudes wasn't a major issue. It's only in the last eight generations or so, with more people living in large, complex societies and having some franchise (control over resources or political influence), that these variations have become critically important. Yet, there's little in our evolutionary or cultural history to prepare us for dealing with this challenge, as it's never been a significant problem before.\n\nThis is why I think the issue of cultural variation in moral foundations is so important. Few people are even aware of it, yet it's fundamental to understanding progress on challenges like equality, poverty, and especially climate change."

    "transcript_text": "But another piece of background, just in case: How are social liberalism and social conservatism measured? I was a tiny bit worried because some people here may have less experience with older contemporary politics. The thing to stress is that when we talk about socially conservative or socially liberal, we are not talking about extremists or authoritarians like these individuals shown here. Admittedly, they've managed to gain support from political factions, but they're not our model for social liberalism or conservatism. Being socially conservative doesn't make you a vicious autocrat, nor does being socially liberal. These are not part of the definitions we're using."

    "transcript_text": "Instead, social conservatism and social liberalism are usually measured by asking people about their attitudes towards a variety of typically divisive issues. For example, \\citet{wolsko:2017_expanding} used a standardised measure asking participants how much they favoured or opposed eight policies, practices, and political groups, including things like capital punishment, making abortion illegal, less strict gun control (in a North American context), more socialized health care, legalization of same-sex marriage, not punishing illegal immigration, Democrats, and Republicans. People are then scored as being more or less socially liberal or socially conservative based on their responses.\n\nYou'll see a variety of measures used in the sources. Shortly, we'll see a study \\citep{vanleeuwen:2009_perceptions} that uses two different measures to show the results seem robust regardless of the specific measure. Another striking thing is that although political views might seem complex, for practical purposes in this research, a one-dimensional model (socially liberal vs. socially conservative) provides a surprisingly powerful explanation. It's an astonishing discovery, in my mind, that politically, humans tend to align along this single dimension in many contexts."

If you tend to think in terms of harm and fairness, you're asked to present a view using considerations like respect for authority and purity.

Moreover, a significant proportion—about a third—actually wrote pieces attacking the other side's ethical attitudes instead of attempting persuasion. Humans are just really bad at dealing with cultural variation in ethical attitudes.\n\n[From later section on why reframing isn't used more:] I mentioned this at the start, but I want to emphasise it again because it's practically important. Moral reframing seems effective. We could potentially make a difference on climate change using it, as achieving unity across the political spectrum often leads to action. The typical approach might be: 'I'm socially liberal, conservatives are wrong, I'll defeat them, then we'll solve climate change.' But this strategy likely won't work. Social conservatives aren't necessarily nasty or misguided, and social conservatism isn't likely to disappear. A better way is to bring everyone along, regardless of ideology, using moral reframing.\n\nSo why isn't this done more? The answer seems to be that it's just really difficult for people to step outside their own moral concerns. This is illustrated by the \\citet{feinberg:2015_gulfa} study I mentioned. They asked liberals and conservatives to write persuasive arguments (4-5 sentences) aimed at the opposing group on relevant issues (e.g., liberals arguing for same-sex marriage to conservatives, conservatives arguing for Official English to liberals). Despite being told their arguments would be tested on the target group and offered a $50 bonus for effectiveness, fewer than 10% actually used moral reframing effectively. Most used their *own* ethical perspectives. Around a third of liberals even attacked conservative morality. Something makes it very difficult for humans to adopt a different ethical perspective; people seem reluctant and find it hard to do. But the choice seems to be: attempt reframing and potentially make progress, or hold onto one's own perspective and face seemingly unsolvable political conflict."

There must be other factors involved.\n\n[Addressing student question about the graph:] We're interested in explaining the variation in responses (e.g., how keen people are on a carbon tax). What this shows is that being a climate sceptic explains only a tiny proportion of that variation. The numbers here represent effect sizes; a common convention suggests r values of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 are small, medium, and large effects, respectively. So, r = .20 is a small effect, bordering on no effect. The important point is that climate scepticism explains very little here."

Let me just remind you about the measurement invariance problem.\n\nThe original MFQ (MFQ-1), developed around 2007 \\citep{haidt:2007_when} and used until roughly 2023, has been shown *not* to exhibit scalar invariance across various groups. Studies found issues comparing Black vs. White participants \\citep{davis:2016_moral}, US vs. Iranian participants \\citep{atari:2020_foundations}, WEIRD vs. non-WEIRD samples \\citep{dogruyol:2019_fivefactor}, and even across social classes within Sweden \\citep{nilsson:2023_measurement}. Some research even questioned the fit of the five-factor model itself across cultures \\citep{iurino:2018_testing}.

Participants also completed measures of support for pro-environmental legislation and belief in global warming, showing similar patterns."

Conservative participants reported greater belief in global warming when exposed to the purity/sanctity message than to the harm/care [...] or neutral message'. This is strange. Why would a persuasive message, framed differently but not necessarily containing new *evidence* about climate science, change beliefs about whether humans are causing global warming? It's not just an isolated finding; \\citet[p. 292]{wolsko:2017_expanding} found a related effect where framing environmentalism in terms of shared group identity ('common ingroup') reduced climate change skepticism compared to other frames. How can changing the ethical frame influence factual beliefs? This is a puzzle.\n\n[Response to Rafi's question:] That's a good point to raise caution. In this specific figure \\citep{feinberg:2013_moral}, the difference for liberals between harm/care and purity/sanctity frames wasn't statistically significant. So, while one might predict a decrease for liberals with the purity frame, these results don't strictly contradict that – they just don't show a significant effect either way for liberals. We must be careful interpreting non-significant differences. Also, comparing the bars directly between the two conditions (harm vs. purity) requires caution as they represent different analyses on potentially different samples or subsets. The core finding here is the significant *increase* for conservatives with the purity frame compared to the harm frame.\n\n[Response to other student question on attitude/belief link:] It's possible that shifting attitudes could influence beliefs, perhaps by making information consistent with the new attitude seem more plausible. But we'd want evidence for that specific mechanism. For now, the belief change remains puzzling."

If you tend to think in terms of harm and fairness, you're asked to present a view using considerations like respect for authority and purity. Conversely, if you put emphasis on purity and respect for authority, you're asked to present arguments appealing to someone with a different moral outlook. What's striking is that very few people succeeded, even with a substantial monetary reward ($50). People generally framed arguments using their own ethical attitudes, not those of their target audience. Moreover, a significant proportion—about a third—actually wrote pieces attacking the other side's ethical attitudes instead of attempting persuasion. Humans are just really bad at dealing with cultural variation in ethical attitudes.\n\n[From later section on why reframing isn't used more:] I mentioned this at the start, but I want to emphasise it again because it's practically important. Moral reframing seems effective. We could potentially make a difference on climate change using it, as achieving unity across the political spectrum often leads to action. The typical approach might be: 'I'm socially liberal, conservatives are wrong, I'll defeat them, then we'll solve climate change.' But this strategy likely won't work. Social conservatives aren't necessarily nasty or misguided, and social conservatism isn't likely to disappear. A better way is to bring everyone along, regardless of ideology, using moral reframing.\n\nSo why isn't this done more? The answer seems to be that it's just really difficult for people to step outside their own moral concerns and see things from a different point of view. This is illustrated by the \\citet{feinberg:2015_gulfa} study I mentioned. They asked liberals and conservatives to write persuasive arguments (4-5 sentences) aimed at the opposing group on relevant issues (e.g., liberals arguing for same-sex marriage to conservatives, conservatives arguing for Official English to liberals). Despite being told their arguments would be tested on the target group and offered a $50 bonus for effectiveness, fewer than 10% actually used moral reframing effectively. Most used their *own* ethical perspectives. Around a third of liberals even attacked conservative morality. Something makes it very difficult for humans to adopt a different ethical perspective; people seem reluctant and find it hard to do. But the choice seems to be: attempt reframing and potentially make progress, or hold onto one's own perspective and face seemingly unsolvable political conflict."

This suggests broad agreement across the political divide on the importance of harm and fairness, even if small differences exist.\n\nThe objection is: If conservatives and liberals regard harm and fairness as roughly equally morally relevant (or only slightly differently), this doesn't strongly predict that framing climate issues in terms of purity (a binding foundation where differences *are* larger) should make conservatives view the issue as *more* moral or be significantly more persuaded than framing it in terms of harm (an individualizing foundation where differences are small).

Why does perceiving a match increase willingness to mitigate climate change? According to \\citet{feinberg:2013_moral}, it's because this perceived match increases the probability that the target will construe the issue itself (climate change) as an ethical issue, thus motivating action.\n\nThis explanation relies heavily on Claim 3 (that liberals and conservatives differ significantly in relevant ways) and the link between Claim 3 and Claim 5. If Objections 2 and 3 hold, this standard explanation is undermined. Theoretically (Objection 3), if conservatives give roughly equal weight to harm and purity, framing in terms of purity shouldn't create a stronger 'match' or increase moralization compared to a harm frame. Empirically (Objection 2), if MFQ-1 didn't reliably measure differences, we can't be sure conservatives *did* perceive a greater match. This doesn't rule out the 'match' explanation, but it means we lack strong reasons to accept it based on the original evidence."

Targets perceive a match between the message's values and their own, leading them to construe the issue as ethical.\nHypothesis 2: Source. Targets identify the source of the message as belonging to their political in-group (cued by the moral language used) and therefore construe the message more favourably, regardless of the specific moral content match. Evidence for this comes from studies like \\citet{fielding:2020_using}."

The key manipulation was the attributed source of the endorsement: either Republican or Democrat politicians. They found that participants' support for the tax increased more when the endorsement came from their *own* political party (in-group) compared to the opposing party (out-group). This suggests the source of a message matters significantly. Based on this, \\citet[p. 196]{fielding:2020_using} conjecture: 'it is possible that the values framing in past studies worked because it provided conservatives with information about the source of the message: when messages aligned with conservative values, Republicans [conservatives] filled in the gaps and simply presumed that the message came from a Republican source'. This provides a potential mechanism for the source hypothesis."

Crucially, this effect was driven by Republicans (39% in Pope prime vs. 30% in control saw it as moral), while Democrats showed no significant difference (58% vs. 61%). This suggests that highlighting a prominent figure perceived differently by political groups can influence moral framing, potentially supporting the idea that source cues matter, especially for certain groups."

    "transcript_text": "Another study relevant to the Match hypothesis is by \\citet{miles:2016_presidential}. Miles noted that within both liberal and conservative groups, there's significant individual variation in how much people care about specific foundations like fairness. Instead of just comparing liberals and conservatives, Miles looked directly at individuals' fairness scores (from the MFQ) and how that interacted with fairness-based rhetoric in political messages (in this case, speeches by President Obama). \n\nThey found that when policy messages used fairness rhetoric, individuals *high* in fairness concerns became more supportive, while those *low* in fairness became less supportive, *regardless* of their overall political ideology \\citep[Figure 1]{miles:2016_presidential}. For example, 'conservatives high in Fairness are more supportive of policies proposed by President Obama than liberals who are low in Fairness' \\citep[p. 486]{miles:2016_presidential}. This strongly suggests that the *match* between the message's moral framing and the individual's own moral profile influences persuasion, cutting across simple political identity or source cues. This finding also potentially addresses the Joan-Lars-Joseph objection by showing that even if group averages on fairness differ only slightly, individual variation within groups is large enough for fairness-based framing to have differential effects based on that individual variation."

They first established that self-reported food waste is linked to believing it's morally wrong. Then, in a subsequent study, they gave participants messages about food waste framed either in terms of harm ('Food waste harms the environment') or disgust/purity ('Food waste attracts dirty animals and pests'). They measured participants' intentions to waste less food and related this to how highly participants ranked harm and purity concerns (using MFQ). They found that harm-based messages primarily influenced intentions among those who ranked harm highly, while disgust-based messages primarily influenced those who ranked purity highly. This provides further state-of-the-art evidence that the *content match* between the message framing and individual moral priorities drives the persuasive effect, rather than just source cues. A limitation is that it measured intentions, not actual food waste behaviour."

'Liberals and conservatives possess different moral profiles': Problematic (Orange). While many studies show this, the measurement invariance issues with MFQ-1 are serious. MFQ-2 helps, but questions remain. We don't know for sure it's true, though the majority view supports it.\n4.  'Liberals more likely to view environment morally, *because* of moral differences': Tricky (Orange). If Claim 3 is uncertain, this causal link is also less certain. Leaning positive, but need more conviction.\n5.  Moral reframing works: Yes, it seems to work (Green). But *why* it works (the mechanism involving conservatives viewing the environment in moral terms due to the frame) is less certain, given the puzzle about Match vs. Source explanations.
